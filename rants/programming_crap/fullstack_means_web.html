FullStack/Full-Stack/Fullstack or whatever you want to call it has become a popular
term. This term was probably coined by someone that felt inferior for being a web
developer. "Well, I don't only do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I know more things."
Well, good for you, but you still make web pages, you are a web developer. I'm sure
a bunch of fullstack devs are angry at me right now, but just think about the following:
I write backends and program hardware and design mobile apps, but I'm not fullstack. I
I have written an HTTPS server on hardware and connected to it through another "proper"
server and had another piece of hardware be a client and I'm not fullstack. I have 
designed desktop and mobile apps to connect to the backend I implemented, still not
fullstack. But, if for any of these projects I had added a web client, then I would
have been fullstack. Actually, maybe not, because my backend wasn't implemented in
JS or any fullstack approved framework, they were implemented in C, Kotlin, and Go.

What "stack" are you talking about? Do you even know what the stack is? There is more
"stack" than: runs on Chrome and maybe runs on Firefox. If anything you are pseudo
webstack and if you are honest with yourself you are a web dev. Nothing wrong with
that, but the term fullstack is ridiculous.
