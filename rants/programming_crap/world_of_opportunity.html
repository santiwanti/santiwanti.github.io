The world is black
a light flickers
it blinks

it draws you to it
demanding your attention

an idea pops up
the light moves
behind it a trail of thoughts

the light blinks
impatient
anxious to move
eager to see where your thoughts will take it

thoughts come rushing to your head
the blinking light dances 
moving at the speed of thought
ideas willed into existence

finally the last idea
the last symbol
the last instruction is transmitted
exhausted you stare at the world you created

the light blinks
ready
willing to continue
satisfied with the choreography
